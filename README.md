## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Server-Side Rendering

Problem: Ensuring the application works seamlessly with both client-side and server-side rendering.
Solution: Leveraged Next.js's getStaticProps and getServerSideProps to fetch Pokémon data dynamically and efficiently.

### Challenge: Handling API Rate Limits

Problem: The Pokémon API imposes rate limits on requests.
Solution: Implemented caching mechanisms to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance.

### Challenge: Styling and Responsiveness

Problem: Ensuring the app looks good on all devices.
Solution: Used Tailwind CSS for flexible and maintainable styling.

### Challenge: Deployment

Problem: Ensuring the app is optimized for hosting platforms.
Solution: Deployed using Vercel (Next.js's native hosting) for easy integration and automatic builds.
